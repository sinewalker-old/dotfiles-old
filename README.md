Personal dotfiles
====

Just another dotfiles repo.  Public because it's not private.

I don't expect there is much here for people to see.

TODO
----

* Actually merge the two old crufty things into one old crufty thing
* Platform detection rather than terminal detection
* Perhaps reorganise it with inspiration from Spacemacs?
* Script to bootstrap this into $HOME with symlincs
