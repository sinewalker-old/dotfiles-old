Personal dotfiles
====

Just another dotfiles repo.  Public because it's not private.

I don't expect there is much here for people to see.

GO TO MY NEW [DOTFILES REPO](dotfiles):  it's much less crufty.  This is just for reference until I have finished reviewing old cruft for inclusion into that. Then I'll probably delete the repo from GitHub.


TODO
----

(I'm nt actually going to do this)

* Actually merge the two old crufty things into one old crufty thing
* Platform detection rather than terminal detection
* Or perhaps use git branches for different systems?
* Perhaps reorganise it with inspiration from Spacemacs?
* Script to bootstrap this into $HOME with symlinks
